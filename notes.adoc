Makes think that Filters

* Running agent confirms the filters and predicates are picked up in reflection.
But relfect has 6268 lines...too much

TODO: run agent with aot profile

* Analizing original code, we see String are converted into FilterDefinition which uses automatic Spring's ObjectToObjectConverter


* Start testing adding used filters and predicates
* Tested creating a new String ->FilterDefinition converter to overide the ObjectToObject, but debugging we see there's a first pass in
GenericConversionService in which the new converter is not there and the generic is cached. A second pass shows the new and other converters.
